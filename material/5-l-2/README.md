# Lab: parallel programming with OpenMP (WIP prerelease)

One of the nice aspects of being a teacher is that if you find a hobby
you enjoy, you can force your students to enjoy it along with you.
One of my hobbies is computer graphics.  For this lab, you will be
investigating the parallelisation of a [Mandelbrot fractal
generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) with OpenMP.
You don't have to understand the mathematics behind the rendering -
all you need to concern yourself with is that there is a program with
a loop that produces a bunch of pixels, and that program needs to run
faster.  It is not at all uncommon to be asked to optimise a program
where you do not fully understand what it computes.
